# Boycott Search
Boycott Search is a tool created by Max for the purpose of checking if a brand you are considering buying is included in any of the recent boycotts.  Right now, it is implemented for Amazon, Target, and Nestle.

As this is a one person project, some of the information may be outdated.  I am hoping to update the page once a month with: 

 - Updated Trademark Database
 - Updated research into current boycotts and reasons for those boycotts
 - Adding dates for targeted boycotts

## Features

 - Responsive search tools
 - High contrast base color scheme makes the page accessible to low-vision users
 - Keyboard Navigable
 - Two Toned Focus Indicator allows for high contrast focusing no matter the user's base color scheme settings. 

# How to Install
- You can access the application here: https://orionstudio7.github.io/BoycottSearch/
- You can also download the the code, and open index.html in your browser.  Make sure not to change the file structure of the downloaded code.
